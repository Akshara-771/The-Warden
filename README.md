# The-Warden üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Akshara C A (solo)

### Project Description
The Warden is a desktop word puzzle game built with Tauri that ambushes the user with a fullscreen window. The app's purpose is to command the user's full attention. It features a unique end-game experience: a celebratory photo and particle animation for winning, or a humiliating insult for losing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In an age of constant busywork, true focus is a rare commodity. The problem isn't a lack of productivity, but a lack of intentionality, as our minds are constantly pulled between a dozen minor distractions. The Warden app addresses this by creating a digital space with no escape. It transforms a simple word puzzle into a test of mental fortitude, with a humiliating penalty for failure. The app ensures that when your focus is demanded, there is nowhere to hide from the task at hand.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Warden‚Äôs solution is both simple and ruthless: if your focus is found wanting, it will be forfeited. The app takes over the user‚Äôs screen, creating a digital cage with nothing but the puzzle. The punishment for failure is not a simple message, but a personal and humiliating judgment, complete with a damning photograph and a custom AI-generated insult. The app ensures that the next time you feel the urge to multitask, you will remember the Warden‚Äôs mocking glare.
